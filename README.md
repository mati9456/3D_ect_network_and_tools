# 3D_ect_network_and_tools
Repository with the network and tools developed for my masters thesis. 

The repository is divided into matlab and python folders. In the matlab folder you can find the code used to generate the dataset that was used and scripts that were used to calculate quality metrics for the tested neural network and traditional ECT image reconstructions algorithms. The ECTsim toolbox is needed to run those scripts. 

In the python folder the network architecture, dataset post processing and loading scripts as well as network training functions can be found. 

The trained model and functions to load it into MATLAB are placed in the torchFuncts folder inside the matlab folder.
